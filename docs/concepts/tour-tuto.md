# Difference between tutorial and tour.

## Explanation

A tutorial shows step by step how to do a specific action. The node elements on which the data is staked can be nodes that are mounted in the DOM as the user clicks (that is called [dynamic steps](./dynamic-steps.md)). You can have multiple tutorials on your page. Each tutorial having a name that serves as an identifier.

A tour shows what this or that element does. These elements must always be in the DOM, so a turn cannot be dinamic and there is only one tour.
